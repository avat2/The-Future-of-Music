Smart Contract Overview
This smart contract is designed to facilitate the creation, sale, and purchase of music tracks on the MetaFeed platform. It allows artists to mint new songs as NFTs, set prices, and sell them to interested buyers. The contract ensures that artists receive fair compensation for their work and that the ownership of the songs is transparent and secure.

Features
Song Creation: Artists can create new songs with details like title, artist name, URI for the song file, and price.
Song Sale: Artists can put their songs up for sale, and buyers can purchase them using Ether.
Ownership Transfer: Upon purchase, the ownership of the song is transferred to the buyer, and the artist receives the payment.
Sale Management: Artists can set or remove songs from sale at any time.
